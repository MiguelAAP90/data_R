‘Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization (Case Study)
This fictional case involving Chicago-area bike ride share program Divvy teaches students how to use publicly available data and tools to create data visualizations that reflect the three rules of the evaluation framework for the visual form: sophisticated use of contrast, clear meaning, and refined execution.

Summary

Lindsay Silk-Kremenak, Director of Marketing for the Chicago area’s Divvy bike-share program, understood the company’s future success depended on a focused approach to marketing that maximized the number of annual memberships. She was sure that data analysis could unlock the insights needed to design marketing strategies that would help her achieve that objective. But what Lindsay knew most certainly was that Divvy’s executive team would only support her team’s recommendations if members communicated their insights through expertly crafted data visualizations.
